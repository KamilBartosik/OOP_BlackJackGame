Description of the rules:
- you need to bet money from your balance (starting amount = 500$) before each round starts
- you play against the dealer; both of you start with 2 cards in your hands, but you see only 1 of the dealers cards
- each card rank has its own assigned value:
          'Two': 2, 'Three': 3, 'Four': 4, 'Five': 5, 'Six': 6, 'Seven': 7, 'Eight': 8, 'Nine': 9, 'Ten': 10,
          'Jack': 10, 'Queen': 10, 'King': 10, 'Ace': 1 or 11 whichever is better in the situation
- goal of the game is to get closer to a total value of 21 than the dealer does
- possible actions:
    - hit (receive another card)
    - stand (stop receiving cards)
- if you exceed value of 21 you lose the round
- after you decide to 'stand' the dealer hits for cards until he has 17 or more points, if he exceeds total value of 21 he loses the round
- if you have value of 21 from your starting cards and dealer has less than 21 you win 150% of your bet
